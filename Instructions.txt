The sequence of code notebooks to be run are:
1. Data Gathering
2. Training data EDA and Topic Modelling
3. Test data analysis
4. Keyword Analysis

Note: All the gathered tweets were in json format. 
The folder containing raw data on my system is extremely large due to which it will take atleast 4 hours 
to copy to another folder.

For analysis the tweets were compiled into a .csv file for each brand. 

Condensed data folder contains the .csv files used for analysis.

Please note: Since the number of tweets collected is extremely high,
if analysis was to be reproduced with raw data, the time taken to condense it would be extremely high 
(It took me 3 and a half hours).

Hence, to save time, since analysis is to be reproduced with condensed data, please skip step 3 in the Data Gathering notebook.

Do change the source and destination addresses according to your system address.
